This image is based on the following ones:

  * php:fpm
    https://github.com/docker-library/php/blob/08bf31dfd492f02a2696c9a30eb85326b1570abd/5.6/fpm/Dockerfile

  * nginx
    https://github.com/dockerfile/nginx/blob/102e2ffe0652aad9c8f0266c2a6d064d4e2b44d8/Dockerfile

Once running, you can quickly add PHP extensions to this image, with docker-php-ext-configure and
docker-php-ext-install scripts.

Out of the box, it offers a working nginx on port 80 and php-fpm webserver.

Your web directory, if you don't add vhosts, is /var/wwwroot/default (mounted as volume).

To rebuild the image:

    docker build --tag nasqueron/nginx-php-fpm .

To launch a container to execute a PHP application in /data/awesome-php-app at http://localhost:8080:

    docker run -d -v /data/awesome-php-app:/var/wwwroot/default -p 8080:80 nasqueron/nginx-php-fpm

To create an image for an application with thisas base, create a Dockerfile:

    FROM nasqueron/docker-nginx-php-fpm
    # Debian commands to deploy your application code
    # If you need other processes, adds a /etc/service/<service name>/run file
    #Â That'is it.
